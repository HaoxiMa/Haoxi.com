<h3><strong>Clinical Trials</strong></h3>
<p>Clinical trials are systematically designed, set of activities that are done to verify the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug (IND).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/1.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase I trial</strong> tests an experimental treatment on a small group of often healthy people (20 to 80) to judge its safety and side effects and to find the correct drug dosage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase II trial</strong> uses more people (100 to 300). While the emphasis in Phase I is on safety, the emphasis in Phase II is on effectiveness. This phase aims to obtain preliminary data on whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition. These trials also continue to study safety, including short-term side effects. This phase can last several years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase III trial</strong> gathers more information about safety and effectiveness, studying different populations and different dosages, using the drug in combination with other drugs. The number of subjects usually ranges from several hundred to about 3,000 people. If the FDA agrees that the trial results are positive, it will approve the experimental drug or device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase IV trial</strong> for drugs or devices takes place after the FDA approves their use. A device or drug’s effectiveness and safety are monitored in large, diverse populations. Sometimes, the side effects of a drug may not become clear until more people have taken it over a longer period of time.</p></li>

<h4>Clinical Study Documents</h4>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/22.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Protocol</strong> <br>
A protocol is a strategy plan on which all clinical trials are based. Specific sections are listed on <a href="https://irb.research.chop.edu/writing-protocol" class="uri">https://irb.research.chop.edu/writing-protocol</a>. The sponsoring organization must approve the protocol and Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each study site reviews the protocol to ensure that participants are treated humanely and ethically. The IRB also discusses such issues as whether the likely benefit of the treatment is worth its risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Informed Consent</strong><br>
All patients should sign the informed consent before they join the trails. The information in it includes details about experimental treatments, tests that must be given the possible risks and benefits of the tests, as well as any standard treatments available for their condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong><br>
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are the list of factors that allow/disallow someone from participating in the clinical trial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)</strong><br>
The SAP is intended to be a comprehensive document that contains a detailed and technical description of the principal features of the analysis outlined in the protocol. It also includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. As compared to the protocol, the SAP should contain an in-depth description of the statistical methods to be used and a definition of the statistical output which will be included in the clinical study report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mock Shells</strong><br>
Mock shells is like the relational schema in SQL. It gives code programmer the general view of all datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case Report Forms (CRF)</strong><br>
CRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all protocol-required information on each subject in a clinical research study.</p></li>

What is happening?
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p align="left">
Your body attacks the cells in your pancreas which means it cannot make any insulin.
</p>
</td>

Your body is unable to make enough insulin or the insulin you do make doesn’t work properly.

Type 1 is managed by taking insulin to control your blood sugar.

You can manage type 2 diabetes in more ways than type 1. These include through medication, exercise and diet. People with type 2 can also be prescribed insulin.

<p><strong>A1C</strong><br>
The A1C test-also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test-is a simple blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It’s one of the commonly used tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes, and is also the main test to help you and your health care team manage your diabetes.</p>
<p>A normal A1C level is below 5.7%, a level of 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or more indicates diabetes. Within the 5.7% to 6.4% prediabetes range, the higher your A1C, the greater your risk is for developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Two Insulin-Taking Ways:</strong><br>
To manage diabetes, people may need insulin and other medication to help control body sugar levels. The two main ways to take insulin are bolus and basal. <code>Bolus insulin</code> is the quick-acting delivery that you often take before mealtimes while <code>basal insulin</code> is longer-acting and helps keep your glucose levels steady day and night.</p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC)</strong><br>
The glucose area under the curve, which is an index of whole glucose excursion after glucose loading, has been widely used for calculating the glycemic index and for evaluating the efficacy of medications for postprandial hyperglycemia.</p>
