<h3><strong>Clinical Trials</strong></h3>
<p>Clinical trials are systematically designed, set of activities that are done to verify the safety and efficacy of an investigational new drug (IND).</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/1.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phase I trial</strong> tests an experimental treatment on a small group of often healthy people (20 to 80) to judge its safety and side effects and to find the correct drug dosage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase II trial</strong> uses more people (100 to 300). While the emphasis in Phase I is on safety, the emphasis in Phase II is on effectiveness. This phase aims to obtain preliminary data on whether the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition. These trials also continue to study safety, including short-term side effects. This phase can last several years.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase III trial</strong> gathers more information about safety and effectiveness, studying different populations and different dosages, using the drug in combination with other drugs. The number of subjects usually ranges from several hundred to about 3,000 people. If the FDA agrees that the trial results are positive, it will approve the experimental drug or device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phase IV trial</strong> for drugs or devices takes place after the FDA approves their use. A device or drug’s effectiveness and safety are monitored in large, diverse populations. Sometimes, the side effects of a drug may not become clear until more people have taken it over a longer period of time.</p></li>

<h4>Clinical Study Documents</h4>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/22.jpg" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Protocol</strong> <br>
A protocol is a strategy plan on which all clinical trials are based. Specific sections are listed on <a href="https://irb.research.chop.edu/writing-protocol" class="uri">https://irb.research.chop.edu/writing-protocol</a>. The sponsoring organization must approve the protocol and Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each study site reviews the protocol to ensure that participants are treated humanely and ethically. The IRB also discusses such issues as whether the likely benefit of the treatment is worth its risk.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Informed Consent</strong><br>
All patients should sign the informed consent before they join the trails. The information in it includes details about experimental treatments, tests that must be given the possible risks and benefits of the tests, as well as any standard treatments available for their condition.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</strong><br>
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are the list of factors that allow/disallow someone from participating in the clinical trial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)</strong><br>
The SAP is intended to be a comprehensive document that contains a detailed and technical description of the principal features of the analysis outlined in the protocol. It also includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. As compared to the protocol, the SAP should contain an in-depth description of the statistical methods to be used and a definition of the statistical output which will be included in the clinical study report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mock Shells</strong><br>
Mock shells is like the relational schema in SQL. It gives code programmer the general view of all datasets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case Report Forms (CRF)</strong><br>
CRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all protocol-required information on each subject in a clinical research study.</p></li>

<h3><strong>Knowledge about Diabetes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How Insulin Works</strong><br>
During digestion, foods that contain carbohydrates are converted into glucose. Most of this glucose is sent into your bloodstream, causing a rise in blood glucose levels. This increase in blood glucose signals your pancreas to produce insulin.</p>
<p>The insulin tells cells throughout your body to take in glucose from your bloodstream. As the glucose moves into your cells, your blood glucose levels go down. Some cells use the glucose as energy. Other cells, such as in your liver and muscles, store any excess glucose as a substance called glycogen.</p>
<p><strong>Sensor Glucose vs Blood Glucose</strong><br>
Your sensor glucose (SG) readings are taken from your interstitial fluid[组织液], and not from your blood, like fingersticks.</p>

<p><strong>A1C</strong><br>
The A1C test-also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test-is a simple blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months. It’s one of the commonly used tests to diagnose prediabetes and diabetes, and is also the main test to help you and your health care team manage your diabetes.</p>
<p>A normal A1C level is below 5.7%, a level of 5.7% to 6.4% indicates prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or more indicates diabetes. Within the 5.7% to 6.4% prediabetes range, the higher your A1C, the greater your risk is for developing type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>Bolus vs Basal Insulin:</strong><br>
To manage diabetes, people may need insulin and other medication to help control body sugar levels. The two main ways to take insulin are bolus and basal. <code>Bolus insulin</code> is the quick-acting delivery that you often take before mealtimes while <code>basal insulin</code> is longer-acting and helps keep your glucose levels steady day and night.</p>
<p><strong>The Glucose Area Under the Curve (AUC)</strong><br>
The glucose area under the curve, which is an index of whole glucose excursion after glucose loading, has been widely used for calculating the glycemic index and for evaluating the efficacy of medications for postprandial hyperglycemia.</p>
<p><strong>Open Loop vs Closed Loop</strong><br>
Insulin therapy is one of the most widely used methods for antidiabetic treatment. In contrast with manually controlled open-loop insulin delivery devices, closed-loop devices are continuously and automatically operated to mimic the natural insulin production process of the pancreas.</p>
<p><strong>Carb Ratio</strong><br>
Your insulin-to-carb ratio (also just called a “carb ratio” or “carb factor”) indicates how many grams of carbohydrate one unit of rapid-acting insulin covers to ensure that your blood glucose stay in your desired range.<br>
E.g. <em>“If my carb ratio is 1:10 and I’m eating 30 grams of carbs, I’ll need 3 units of rapid-acting insulin to cover the meal”</em></p>
<p><strong>Types of Insulin</strong><br>
Terms to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Onset - How quickly insulin lowers your blood sugar.</li>
<li>Peak Time - When insulin is at maximum strength.</li>
<li>Duration - How long insulin works to lower your blood sugae.</li>

<h3><strong>Design of Experiment</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Multi-center</strong><br>
A multicenter research trail is a clinical trail conducted at more than one medical center or clinic. Most large clinical trails, particularly Phase III trails, are conducted at several clinical research centers</p>
<p><strong>Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)</strong><br>
RCT is a study in which people are allocated at random (by chance alone) to receive one of several clinical interventions. One of these interventions is the standard of comparison or control. The control may be a standard practice, a placebo (“sugar pill”), or no intervention at all. RCTs seek to measure and compare the outcomes after the participants receive the interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Parallel Group Study</strong><br>
When every participant receives one and only one treatment in a random manner, this kind of complete randomized design is called a parallel group design. The most important element of this design is randomization which means participants are randomly placed into a group to lower the risk of statistical bias or other kinds of erroneous results.<br></p>
<p>Generally, researchers use either one of the two types of parallel group designs in a comparative clinical trial, that is, parallel group (or group comparison) designs or matched-pair parallel designs (Figure below). Based on certain characteristics, participants are first paired in matched-pair parallel design. Within one pair, each member will be assigned to different study subgroups randomly, which makes it possible to compare similar participants undergoing diverse procedures between each other. A treatment group vs. a control group is the simplest two-group comparison parallel-group design. In each treatment group there are usually the nearly same amount of participants that’s not always the case.<br></p>
<p>A parallel group design is very different from a crossover design in which one group of participants receives treatment A first followed by B then while the other group does the opposite. However, there is also a significant issue in a parallel trial. Researchers must take into consideration the intra subject variability, the variability within the same participants in responses to treatment.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/WechatIMG667.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Cross-over Study</strong><br>
The AB/BA model is the simplest type of crossover trial. At first, participants of one group will receive medication A and after a wash-out period, participants of the same group will receive medication B. The same applies to the second study group, but the other way around. Extensions to this form include the ABC/CBA/BCA regimens.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2021-10-10-biostatistical-note_files/WechatIMG666.png" /></p>
<p><em>[Advantages]</em><br>
By using a crossover trial in order to compare several interventions, a researcher can minimize the risk of confounding because all interventions are measured on the same participants. One can say that study participants serve as their own control. This leads to another advantage which is less study participants are required compared to a standard parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT). Reduction of sample size is consistent with the principle in medical research to use resources wisely. Furthermore, blinding of study participants can be maintained and statistical tests assuming randomization can be used.</p>
<p><em>[Limitations]</em><br>
This design sounds very appealing, however there are various limitations that need to be considered:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Crossover trials can only be conducted when the disease persists for a longer period of time, hence, crossover trials are mostly used in studying chronic diseases. There are some short-term illnesses or acute conditions that might be cured once they are treated and there are treatments that will have a permanent effect (i.e. surgery) on the patient. It is usually not possible to perform crossover trials in such cases.<br></p></li>
<li><p>There is a great risk for aliasing. This term describes the risk that there might be a carry-over from the effect of the previous intervention on to the effect of the next intervention thereby altering results. Therefore, the treatment effect might not only be due to the treatment itself, but also due to interactions between treatment and study-period/sequence. Statistical tests have been suggested in order to test the carry-over risk, but a great chance of a type-II error (falsely accepting the null hypothesis, here: falsely accepting the hypothesis that there is no interaction between treatment and study-period or study-group) persists.<br></p></li>
<li><p>It is difficult to estimate the time required in order for the intervention to be fully washed-out. While it might be relatively simple to estimate the wash-out period when the intervention is given as a drug looking at the half-life of the studied medications, things become a lot trickier when the interventions include psychological therapies, for example.<br></p></li>
<li><p>In contrast to parallel designs, crossover trials consist of two study periods. This means that they usually take up more time, and statistical analysis can be more complicated if participants do not complete all stages of the trial.<br></p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, crossover trials are a good study design that can be used to efficiently compare interventions on as few participants as possible when studying chronic diseases. However, many requirements (low risk of carry-over, wash-out period etc.) must be met and therefore it is not used as often as a parallel RCTs.</p>

<h3><strong>Statistical Knowledge</strong></h3>
<p><strong>ITT Principle</strong><br>
The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle is a cornerstone in the interpretation of randomized clinical trails conducted with the goal of influencing the selection of medical therapy for well-defined groups of patients. The ITT principle defines both the study population included in the primary effect analysis and how the outcomes are analyzed.</p>
<p>Under ITT, study participants are analyzed as members of the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of their adherence to, or whether they received, the intended treatment. For example, in a trail in which patients are randomized to receive either treatment A or treatment B, a patient may be randomized to receive treatment A but erroneously receive treatment B, or never receive any treatment, or not adhere to treatment A. In all of these situations, the patient whould be included in group A when comparing treatment outcomes using an ITT analysis.</p>
